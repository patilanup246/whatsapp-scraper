**Preliminary Ethical Guidelines:**
1 - Do not collect or store people's names, phone numbers, e-mails or other personal identifying information.
2 - Hash images and only save them if they meet certain criteria (e.g. shared over 1000 times, contains text.)
3 - Use public WhatsApp groups only.
4 - Do not quote individuals in stories without their permission unless it is of clear public interest (e.g. Trump participating in discussion).
5 - Do not use deception. If anyone asks you directly who you are, say that you are a journalist and explain your project. 
6 - Do not use the tool in any way that would violate WhatsApp's Terms of Service. Example: this tool cannot be used for commercial purposes. Regularly check for changes to the TOS.
